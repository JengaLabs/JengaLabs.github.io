            <p>Family of Bison. This image had pretty good framing to show what a image that can portray the story of the bison just roaming the land. They are incredibly beutiful creatures which have the appearence of dinosaurs when you first see them</p>

            <p>Grand Canyon of Yellowstone Waterfall. This was my favorite part of the trip the scale of the Canyon was amazing and the waterfall was stunning. First place I've seen in a while that actually took my breath away.</p>

            <p>Fairy Falls Waterfall. First hike we did ended up being about 6 miles total which was alot for a hot day. Super worth the trek though because the falls was one of the highlights of my trip.</p>

        <aside>
            <img class="photos" src="../aidenPictures/lake.JPG" />
            <p>Yellowstone Lake. Foggy day allowed my to capture this mysterious picture not one of the most flashy of the trip but I think it ended up being one of my favorite because of the creative composition.</p>

            <img class="photos" src="../aidenPictures/GrandTeton1.JPG" />
            <p>Grand Teton National Park right next to Yellowstone. Long 4 hour drive there and back to see the Tetons it was rainy which was pretty unlucky but it is still an amazing sight to see.

            <p>Mammoth Springs. Mammoth Springs is an otherworldy experience the strange colors and dead vegitation makes it an alien landscape when combined with the steam produced by the springs. The whole place is also coverd in the smell of rotton eggs.
