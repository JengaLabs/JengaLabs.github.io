            Tips & Tricks
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Be prepared to spend alot of time in the car! </li>
            <li>Bring binoculars because most of the wildlife you will see will be quite a distance</li>
            <li>If there are alot of cars stopped and you see a crowd of people most likely they are looking at something pretty rare</li>
            <li>There are a few guided Yellowstone tour apps that use you location to give you a tour of park real time while you drive around</li>
            <li>Almost all the park has no signal so if you need to access the internet or text someone make sure you do it before you enter the park</li>
            <li>If you want to enjoy the park in more of a personal experience many of the longer hikes will allow you to get away from all the car tourists</li>
            <li>Bring enough food and water to last you the day because there are only a few restruants in the park and it takes a while to get around.</li>
            <li>Make sure you know the road closings before you go because some of the places there is only one road to get there</li>
            <li>Brush up on your parking skills because it will be a challenge to find a spot and you need to be ready when you find one</li>
            <li>Don't focus to much on just Yellowstone when you visit the sournding area also have lots places to explore</li>
            <li>MOST IMPORTANT TIP: The earlier you get there the faster you will get through the gate and find a parking spot at the major locations</li>
            <li>Be careful and check the fire conditions because currently the area is coverd in them</li>
            <li>My favorite places were always the less traveled ones find pullofs nobody else is taking and just have a look around it also helps to strech your legs</li>
            <li>View gyser activity here! <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/geyser-activity.htm">NPS gyser activity</a></li>
