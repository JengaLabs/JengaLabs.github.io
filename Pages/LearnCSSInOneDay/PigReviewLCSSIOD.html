                            While I enjoyed the book for a quick read, throughout the read it felt like examples of use cases were not really covered. The exercise files seemed to just be regurgitations of what’s discussed in a chapter. Each chapter just stating how to use a css property, not giving the reader a chance to show they really absorbed the material. Lack of explanation could be justified by the writer attempting to keep the book short and concise. That does not excuse exercise files lacking in any substance and proper examples to follow.

                            Display and Visibility I found to be a very useful chapter. While I was familiar with the display property, the specifics behind inline and block values can be tricky. The Visibility property can be very powerful, however the true power behind it isn’t touched.

                            Background property leads to the creation of more stylistic sites. Background attachment being another unknown property to me. Again, no real discussion of how this property could be used effectively. Just notifying you that it indeed is a CSS feature.

                            Text and font properties can make or break a site. This chapter does cover changing site fonts, but not adding in your own custom fonts. While not exactly something a beginner would want to do, it’s something they should do.

                            Navigation Bars are one of the first steps to creating multi page sites. While there are many solutions to creating a navigation bar. The book only covers hyperlink styling and types of lists with their CSS properties. The exercise file does show one solution, but lacks explanation behind the solution.

                            Tables are a great introduction to CSS for beginners as it’s a concept many are already familiar with. As well soon enough the reader will learn its limitations leading them to the use of Flex boxes and more advanced practices.
