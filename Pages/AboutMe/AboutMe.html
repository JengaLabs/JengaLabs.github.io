                            &nbsp;&nbsp; I heard that quote in the middle of a Civilization VI game and took a moment to resonate with it. I struggle to
                            accurately portray my own character to others in a concise manner.I prefer using my environment to build an image of me.
                            Thus, here are questions from those closest to me to internet strangers.

                        <p>
                            I love living in a house I can modify to my liking. Wanna put a hole through the wall or paint the walls ect. However I don&#8217;t want a yard personally, rather a community garden of sorts. Another big plus would be not having to own a car. Walking and biking to places always feels great.
