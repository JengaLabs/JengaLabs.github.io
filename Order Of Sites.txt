About Pig
I'm Pig, the man behind this site's code and all other content as you may have noticed.
This is my first real site outside of the classroom setting so bear with me. To quote
a familiar figure “Dude, suckin’ at something is the first step to being sorta good at something.”
- Jake the Dog.

<h2> Software Developer </h2>
<p>
A bold title to give one&lsquo;s self, but to be fair people are calling themselves gurus of technology
these days. On a good week I can be combining three to four design patterns, other days I&lsquo;m googling &rdquo;hello world&ldquo; in HTML. Never fear, however, as it's all part of the learning adventure, and when I&lsquo;m
rolling and rocking I get to make all sorts of amazing applications. </p> 

<h2> Scientist? </h2> <p> A scientist is described as &rdquo;someone who systematically gathers and uses research and evidence, to make hypotheses and test them, to gain and share understanding and knowledge&ldquo; on the authority of Science Council. I have no credentials nor would I show them online that verifies I&lsquo;m any kind of scientist. However, I do try my best to follow scientific approaches and present my research with enough evidence to qualify for real research documents. </p>

<h2> Still a Student </h2> <p> I'm in high school as of now with about a year left. Of course after school, I still plan on researching and taking courses on areas of interest. Software Development, Computer Science, Biology, Rocket Science, Mathematics, Piano, Engineering, Chemistry, and lots more are things I intend to cover at some point. For now though I'll pick up what I can and work with it. </p>
